This book teaches C by example, with complete C programs used to illustrate each new concept along the way. 
"Stephen Kochan" provides step-by-step explanations for all C functions.
I found also a tutorial by "J David Eisenberg" on youtube : https://youtu.be/Bm5eFiGwzb4?feature=shared

looks quite good and serious.
